As a beady-eyed youngster I distinctly remember telling my parents I was going to be a vet out in Japan working at the base of mount Fuji. Obviously, at that age I had no idea the logistical challenges such a move would bring. Even if I were to study veterinary medicine and Japanese simultaneously, I very much doubt there would be any appetite for a practice opening at the base of a mountain.</description></item><item><title>Finally, change</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/finally-change/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/finally-change/</guid><description>Some big life changes The last time I posted anything here was August 2020. Wow. That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty substantial break, but it does also coincide with the last time I had any time off work. So in a way it makes sense.
A lot has happened since then, but the biggest thing for me personally is that I have taken a job opportunity out in Germany. I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get out of the UK for a while now, so to have finally managed to secure an opportunity is pretty huge for me.</description></item><item><title>Burnout</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/burnout/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2020 08:41:21 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/burnout/</guid><description>In December 2019, I was given a new role at work. This was with the understanding that there would need to be a transition period while I trained my replacement (I work with a very big, poorly documented product, which means that training is a very big task), but that I could expect to be out of my current role within 6 months.
7 months later, we have not even appointed somebody to the new role.</description></item><item><title>Roswell for everyone!</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/roswell-for-everyone/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/roswell-for-everyone/</guid><description>This website uses coleslaw as a static site generator. Coleslaw is managed using Roswell. Some of my bots are written in lisp and packaged using Roswell. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say I like Roswell.
As mentioned a little while ago I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching myself how to write FreeBSD ports. Since I run this site on a FreeBSD box, it is only logical that I would try to package the tools I&amp;rsquo;m using.</description></item><item><title>More speed improvements</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/more-speed/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 03:39:15 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/more-speed/</guid><description>A little while ago I made some significant changes to this website&amp;rsquo;s design, asset delivery, and build system. Recently, however, I decided to do some benchmarking against a friend&amp;rsquo;s site to see how it stacked up and I was surprised to see that my site was still significantly slower than it could be, and it was also failing some Lighthouse tests when run through Chromium. I decided to take the time to fix these recently and have madethe following changes:</description></item><item><title>Python programming</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/python-programming/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/python-programming/</guid><description>Your browser does not support the video tag. I&amp;rsquo;ve been having some fun learning Python recently as part of a course I&amp;rsquo;m doing. One of our early assignments was to create a simple saponification calculator which would return the amount of lye and water required to make soap from some given oils.
My personal goal in all of this is to be able to make graphical programs, as I always seem to fall at that hurdle.</description></item><item><title>Site speed improvements</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/site-speed-improvements/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/site-speed-improvements/</guid><description>I got poking around at this site and was doing some thinking. Mainly along the lines of speed and security. By default, the dark-hyde theme provided by the good folks over at Coleslaw uses Google&amp;rsquo;s CDN for font delivery. This is all well and good, however I&amp;rsquo;m really not a big fan of Google at all and like to avoid them where possible. With that in mind, I started thinking about how I could go about replacing them.</description></item><item><title>Building smarter</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/building-smarter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 02:23:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/building-smarter/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to improve the way I deploy this website for a little while now. Since I stopped using Netlify in favour of a more bare-bones approach, there has been a lot of manual/ugly work involved with the process of updating this website and posting from its RSS feed to my Mastodon feed.
Initially, I simply cloned the git repository for this site to my FreeBSD box and then SSHd in to the box to pull the lates files.</description></item><item><title>Playing with ports</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/playing-with-ports/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 22:38:36 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/playing-with-ports/</guid><description>As mentioned in my previous post, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been playing around with FreeBSD on one of my laptops. Why? Boredom, frankly. Boredom with my job, boredom with my lack of social life, boredom with the weather. Whatever the cause, the cure is always computer fun!
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used FreeBSD you&amp;rsquo;re probably already well aware of the ports system. It&amp;rsquo;s the thing that scares people because you mentioned the dreaded &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; word</description></item><item><title>Going green</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/going-green/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 21:24:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/going-green/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m always surprised when I see modern companies not using renewable energy sources as a matter of course. It seems so strange to me that they don&amp;rsquo;t see that this is a really big draw, especially in the tech industry where at least 70% of us are weird hippies. The other day I decided to do a little research on my host&amp;rsquo;s (DigitalOcean) offerings and the differences between the datacentre, and I was surprised to find out the following:</description></item><item><title>Moving to FreeBSD</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/moving-to-freebsd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 22:09:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/moving-to-freebsd/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making some changes to my current website setup. Before, this site was hosted on the same server that currently hosts my Mastodon instance and Funkwhale pod, as well as my git server. But with gitea&amp;rsquo;s poor performance and the general overcrowding, mixed in with my recent winding down of my Streama server, I decided to make a completely new server for my website.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of playing around with FreeBSD lately as part of my never-ending quest to find the ideal operating system.</description></item><item><title>A new year</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/a-new-year/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 01:59:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/a-new-year/</guid><description>2019 was a bit of a rocky year, admittedly. With the country in which I reside resigning itself utterly to lunacy, my relationship ending, and a general descent in my mental health at several points due to work and existing issues, it is not a year I will necessarily look back on with much fondness. All is not, however, doom and gloom.
Funky friends Back in February of 2019 I started committing to Funkwhale.</description></item><item><title>Coleslaw migration</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/coleslaw-migration/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/coleslaw-migration/</guid><description>This marks my third(?) migration to a new site format! ðŸŽ‰
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started learning to use Emacs after leaving the Emacs manual lying around for the better part of a year. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try my hand at some common lisp I figured it would be a good time to start learning, and my goodness I wish I&amp;rsquo;d started this sooner.
As part of this new experience I started looking into ways I could use Lisp in my everyday life.</description></item><item><title>weeabot</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/weeabot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/weeabot/</guid><description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been having some fun recently trying to teach myself Rust. I&amp;rsquo;m not really a programmer by any stretch of the imagination (yet!) but was challenged to write a bot for a Matrix chatroom I frequent. Most of us have written bots already, so it was my time to try something.
Originally I had planned to use Python like I had done previously for my Mastodon bot, tsukumogami. However, I&amp;rsquo;d been hearing some interesting things about Rust and decided it would be a fun challenge to try and write something functional in the language.</description></item><item><title>Going free</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/going-free/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/going-free/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with and enjoying technology most of my life. As such (and given the long history of vendor lock-in and associated cost/challenge with going without the support of major tech companies), I have a pretty significant footprint with certain tech companies. I&amp;rsquo;ve been with Google/Gmail/Android for many years. I have files stored up on Onedrive and Google Cloud. I have been working with Windows, ChromeOS, and even macOS and iOS at various stages as long as I have been working with computers.</description></item><item><title>Moving to Sphinx</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/moving-to-sphinx/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/moving-to-sphinx/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few changes to this website. Well, not really a few changes, more like a complete overhaul. I was getting a bit bored of using Hugo/Markdown and decided to challenge myself to the following:
Move to Sphinx Enable Ablog Move away from Github to Gitlab Get Netlify CI working with the new setup This wasn&amp;rsquo;t too difficult in theory, more time consuming (what can I say? I get bored).</description></item><item><title>Matrix is here</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/matrix-is-here/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/matrix-is-here/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about it beforeâ€¦ And it&amp;rsquo;s finally here! After much head scratching, frustration, and eventually the building of an entirely new server, my Matrix server garappa.chat is up and running. This has been something I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about doing for a while as I try to get away from all bigger services in favour of hosting my own. While Mastodon and Funkwhale where considerably easier to set up, I have a feeling it will be worth it in the end.</description></item><item><title>New developments</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/new-developments/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/new-developments/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while Every time I have a blog I am always really bad at posting to it consistently. Actually, a lot has changed in recent months so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a little brain dump.
Funkwhale Thanks to the lovely people at Funkwhale I&amp;rsquo;m finally getting involved properly with a software project. To date I&amp;rsquo;ve provided a couple of new (extremely simple) features and bugfixes, as well as leading a large project to restructure the documentation and provide a slew of new user guides.</description></item><item><title>Progress</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/progress/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/progress/</guid><description>Making a difference It feels good to actually have a positive impact on something. One of my biggest gripes about working in support is that you are â€“ as a support agent â€“ inevitably the face of disappoinment and/or failure at some point. The job is time and attention demanding, and sometimes you simply have to tell someone that things they want are not possible.
This is devastating for morale. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in all my support jobs: the tickets keep coming and all you can do is try to answer them all in SLA.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye, Guix</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/goodbye-guix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/goodbye-guix/</guid><description>A fond farewell So for the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been exclusively using GuixSD on my X200s. It&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting experiment, and there are a good many things I really liked about the system. For now, though, I am going back to Parabola.
Guix For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, GNU Guix is a package manager which makes use of Guile to offer a really hackable and minutely controllable software management experience.</description></item><item><title>More writing</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/more-writing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/more-writing/</guid><description>And now for something completely different I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing posts on this website for a little while now, mostly relating to my technological exploits and sysadmin misadventures. While this is a big part of my life at the moment, it&amp;rsquo;s not the only thing I do. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and write a bit more about non-technology things just to try to encourage myself to focus on other things alongside computers.</description></item><item><title>Tanuki Tunes update</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/tanuki-tunes-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/tanuki-tunes-update/</guid><description>Another Funkwhale update After a little bit of frustration on my side due to not following the directions properly, Tanuki Tunes is now running Funkwhale 0.18.1. The changes in this version will be mostly invisible to end-users, but include important bugfixes such as one that prevented the editing of tracks in the Django admin panel. This update has also made me aware that the site was previously running an out-of-date version of Postgresql.</description></item><item><title>Baku Social news</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/baku-social-news/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/baku-social-news/</guid><description>Technical updates So it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit of a busy month for Baku Social. The server experienced some minor downtime at the end of December owing to high memory usage, however there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been anything breeching the limits since then so fingers crossed there is no need yet to upgrade the specs of the VPS itself. I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to monitor it to ensure that nothing goes overboard, but given the low traffic both it and Tanuki Tunes seem to be managing fine for the moment.</description></item><item><title>Baku Social</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/baku-social/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/baku-social/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a project recently to teach me some more about various technologies, specifically public cloud stuff like AWS and container tech like Docker. I have been looking to get into this stuff for a little while and even previously hosted on of my blogs on a container OS, but that was shortlived due to too many headaches with Wordpress containers. For the last few months I had also been looking for a way to replace Spotify â€“ which I had left behind due to privacy concerns, costs, and library limitations (I listen to someâ€¦ weird stuff).</description></item><item><title>Thermy</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/thermy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/thermy/</guid><description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying for a number of years that I&amp;rsquo;d really like to get into app development, but have never really had a project to work on. This is usually my struggle. I am the sort of person who learns by doing, but until I have a need to do something I can&amp;rsquo;t bring myself to learn.
Following on from my previous post I have been using the latest release of elementaryOS for the last few days and having a poke around at their documentation.</description></item><item><title>New site</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/new-site/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/new-site/</guid><description>As the astute among you may have noticed, this site has undergone some changes over the last couple of days. That&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;ve now completely moved away from Wordpress and destroyed my old server in favour of a different provider.
There are a couple of reasons for this:
The server was costing me money that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to spare Wordpress is slow and cumbersome. Even a simple site like this was taking far too long to load I wasn&amp;rsquo;t learning anything by using Wordpress This last point is the reason I&amp;rsquo;ve moved to the solution I have.</description></item><item><title>Deploying and controlling Google Chrome settings using Microsoft Intune</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/deploying-controlling-chrome-intune/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/deploying-controlling-chrome-intune/</guid><description>Righto. This one has given me a mild headache for the last couple of days, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found a workable solution that allows me to set a home page for users in Chrome.

New to me, anyway. And as you might expect, I&amp;rsquo;m really bad at them. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about that!
Why did it have to be Moodle? I work in a very Microsoft-centric environment. The vast majority of our servers are Windows 2016, 2012 R2, and a few straggling 2008 R2 boxes which just refuse to die. Possibly for this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve never had a GNU/Linux technician.</description></item><item><title>Some more Windows work</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/some-more-windows-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/some-more-windows-work/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I last posted here.

Or not. Who knows? More importantly, who cares what you think? It&amp;rsquo;s my blog and I WILL cry when I want to.

It seems that the people with whom I most frequently interact are computer scientists or software developers. I donâ€™t really know why, other than they are the only people crazy enough to use Riot for their day-to-day communications and chatroom facility. For this reason, Iâ€™m surrounded by programming with little to no comprehension of what is going on the majority of the time.</description></item><item><title>PGP problems promise pounding headaches</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/pgp-problems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/pgp-problems/</guid><description>Letâ€™s clear up some FUD At the moment, information on this flaw is scarce, so as always itâ€™s best to wait until the paper is published (which EFF says will be done at 07:00 UTC on May 15th).

Firstly, it does not look like this is a flaw with PGP itself, but rather with implementations of GPG used in email programs such as Enigmail.</description></item><item><title>Another day, another Intel fail</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/intel-fail/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 May 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/intel-fail/</guid><description>A few years ago, I&amp;rsquo;d have been shocked to see the sort of vulnerabilities I see announced these days once a year, let alone once a month. But the rise of cybersecurity as a respected industry has led to the big companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Canonical, etc. pulling up their socks and crushing vulnerabilities in a timely manner. This is all great, except for those of us whose job it is to deploy these fixes.</description></item><item><title>Deploying Sophos in a production environment</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/deploying-sophos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 May 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/deploying-sophos/</guid><description>AntiVirus is a necessary evil. With the world more connected than ever before, every device needs protection and tools to allow administrators oversight. Currently, the AV I work with is Sophos' cloud-based solution for Windows, Mac, and Linux. When I was working on the frontline, I quickly became aware that Sophos did not deploy during imaging as it had initially done, nor could it easily be pushed out via SCCM. We spent a long time going around to each freshly imaged machine and loading Sophos on, rebooting the machine, and logging tickets to have its policy applied.</description></item></channel></rss>
