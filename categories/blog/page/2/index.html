It seems so strange to me that they don't see that this is a really big draw, especially in the tech industry where at least 70% of us are weird hippies.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/moving-to-freebsd/><section><h2 class=title>Moving to FreeBSD</h3><time datetime=2020-02-04>Feb 4, 2020</time><p>I've been doing a lot of playing around with FreeBSD lately as part of my never-ending quest to find the ideal operating system. There are some things I absolutely love about the system, and its minimalist setup and hardy security defaults made it the ideal candidate to set my website up on.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/a-new-year/><section><h2 class=title>A new year</h3><time datetime=2020-01-12>Jan 12, 2020</time><p>2019 was a bit of a rocky year, admittedly. With the country in which I reside resigning itself utterly to lunacy, my relationship ending, and a general descent in my mental health at several points due to work and existing issues, it is not a year I will necessarily look back on with much fondness. All is not, however, doom and gloom.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/coleslaw-migration/><section><h2 class=title>Coleslaw migration</h3><time datetime=2019-11-02>Nov 2, 2019</time><p>I've recently started learning to use Emacs after leaving the Emacs manual lying around for the better part of a year. Since I've decided to try my hand at some common lisp I figured it would be a good time to start learning, and my goodness I wish I'd started this sooner.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/weeabot/><section><h2 class=title>weeabot</h3><time datetime=2019-07-06>Jul 6, 2019</time><p>So I've been having some fun recently trying to teach myself Rust I'm not really a programmer by any stretch of the imagination (yet!) but was challenged to write a bot for a Matrix chatroom I frequent. Most of us have written bots already, so it was my time to try something.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/going-free/><section><h2 class=title>Going free</h3><time datetime=2019-06-11>Jun 11, 2019</time><p>I've been working with and enjoying technology most of my life. As such (and given the long history of vendor lock-in and associated cost/challenge with going without the support of major tech companies), I have a pretty significant footprint with certain tech companies.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/moving-to-sphinx/><section><h2 class=title>Moving to Sphinx</h3><time datetime=2019-05-08>May 8, 2019</time><p>I've made a few changes to this website. Well, not really a few changes, more like a complete overhaul. I was getting a bit bored of using Hugo/Markdown and decided to challenge myself to using Sphinx and rST instead.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/matrix-is-here/><section><h2 class=title>Matrix is here</h3><time datetime=2019-04-24>Apr 24, 2019</time><p>And it's finally here! After much head scratching, frustration, and eventually the building of an entirely new server, my Matrix server is up and running.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/new-developments/><section><h2 class=title>New developments</h3><time datetime=2019-04-17>Apr 17, 2019</time><p>It&rsquo;s been a little while Every time I have a blog I am always really bad at posting to it consistently. Actually, a lot has changed in recent months so I thought I&rsquo;d do a little brain dump.
Funkwhale Thanks to the lovely people at Funkwhale I&rsquo;m finally getting involved properly with a software project. To date I&rsquo;ve provided a couple of new (extremely simple) features and bugfixes, as well as leading a large project to restructure the documentation and provide a slew of new user guides.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/progress/><section><h2 class=title>Progress</h3><time datetime=2019-02-11>Feb 11, 2019</time><p>It feels good to actually have a positive impact on something. One of my biggest gripes about working in support is that you are – as a support agent – inevitably the face of disappoinment and/or failure at some point.…</p></section></a><nav class=pagination><a class=previous href=/categories/blog/>Newer</a>
