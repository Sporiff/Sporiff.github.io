Me neither until a little while ago. My friend had originally introduced me to Void when I was looking at going back to Arch Linux a few years ago, stating that it was (in many ways) a vastly superior system.

Summary (for those who don&rsquo;t want to read) I like Elementary OS. It does plenty right and offers a minimalist system with decent keyboard control, a healthy environment which encourages users to invest in developers, and it largely keeps out of my way while offering the power of Ubuntu under the hood.</p></section></a><nav class=pagination><a class=next href=/categories/reviews/page/2/>Older</a></nav></body></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
