I&amp;rsquo;m not really a programmer by any stretch of the imagination (yet!) but was challenged to write a bot for a Matrix chatroom I frequent. Most of us have written bots already, so it was my time to try something.
Originally I had planned to use Python like I had done previously for my Mastodon bot, tsukumogami. However, I&amp;rsquo;d been hearing some interesting things about Rust and decided it would be a fun challenge to try and write something functional in the language.</description></item></channel></rss>
