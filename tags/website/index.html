Mainly along the lines of speed and security. By default, the dark-hyde theme provided by the good folks over at Coleslaw uses Google&rsquo;s CDN for font delivery. This is all well and good, however I&rsquo;m really not a big fan of Google at all and like to avoid them where possible. With that in mind, I started thinking about how I could go about replacing them.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/building-smarter/><section><h2 class=title>Building smarter</h3><time datetime=2020-04-19>Apr 19, 2020</time><p>I've been meaning to improve the way I deploy this website for a little while now. Since I stopped using Netlify in favour of a more bare-bones approach, there has been a lot of manual/ugly work involved with the process of updating this website and posting from its RSS feed to my Mastodon feed.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/coleslaw-migration/><section><h2 class=title>Coleslaw migration</h3><time datetime=2019-11-02>Nov 2, 2019</time><p>I've recently started learning to use Emacs after leaving the Emacs manual lying around for the better part of a year. Since I've decided to try my hand at some common lisp I figured it would be a good time to start learning, and my goodness I wish I'd started this sooner.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/moving-to-sphinx/><section><h2 class=title>Moving to Sphinx</h3><time datetime=2019-05-08>May 8, 2019</time><p>I've made a few changes to this website. Well, not really a few changes, more like a complete overhaul. I was getting a bit bored of using Hugo/Markdown and decided to challenge myself to using Sphinx and rST instead.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/more-writing/><section><h2 class=title>More writing</h3><time datetime=2019-02-03>Feb 3, 2019</time><p>I've been writing posts on this website for a little while now, mostly relating to my technological exploits and sysadmin misadventures. While this is a big part of my life at the moment, it's not the only thing I do.</p></section></a><nav class=pagination></nav></body></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciar√°n Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
