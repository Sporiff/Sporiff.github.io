I&amp;rsquo;ve been having some fun learning Python recently as part of a course I&amp;rsquo;m doing. One of our early assignments was to create a simple saponification calculator which would return the amount of lye and water required to make soap from some given oils.

It seems that the people with whom I most frequently interact are computer scientists or software developers. I don’t really know why, other than they are the only people crazy enough to use Riot for their day-to-day communications and chatroom facility. For this reason, I’m surrounded by programming with little to no comprehension of what is going on the majority of the time.</description></item></channel></rss>
