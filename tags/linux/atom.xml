Given that I started this tradition before I was particularly proficient with GNU/Linux and *BSD, I have usually taken to using Ubuntu as a crutch of sorts. Now, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with Ubuntu per se, but it nearly always has more than I need preinstalled and removing software is a bigger risk than adding it.</description></item><item><title>Into the Void</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/into-the-void/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/into-the-void/</guid><description>Ever heard of Void Linux? Me neither until a little while ago. My friend had orginally introduced me to Void when I was looking at going back to Arch Linux a few years ago, stating that it was (in many ways) a vastly superior system. I was intrigued, but I ultimately ended up sticking with Arch as I was familiar with it and was unwilling to give up on using the AUR at that point.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye, Guix</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/goodbye-guix/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/goodbye-guix/</guid><description>A fond farewell So for the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been exclusively using GuixSD on my X200s. It&amp;rsquo;s been an interesting experiment, and there are a good many things I really liked about the system. For now, though, I am going back to Parabola.
Guix For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, GNU Guix is a package manager which makes use of Guile to offer a really hackable and minutely controllable software management experience.</description></item><item><title>Elementary OS Juno</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/elementary-juno/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/elementary-juno/</guid><description>Note: I have contributed translations to the Elementary OS project and have been an active Patreon supporter since April 2018. I don&amp;rsquo;t think of myself as particularly biased, but it&amp;rsquo;s best to mention these things
Summary (for those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to read) I like Elementary OS. It does plenty right and offers a minimalist system with decent keyboard control, a healthy environment which encourages users to invest in developers, and it largely keeps out of my way while offering the power of Ubuntu under the hood.</description></item><item><title>Personal matters</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/personal-matters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/personal-matters/</guid><description>This post is more of a rant than anything technical. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a moan born of recent frustrations. Nevertheless, this is my website. Where better to moan?
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started a new job working for a software company. My day-to-day work mostly includes rifling through SQL databases and making changes as well as searching for causes of issues faced by customers. This job has me using a work-issued MacBook Air and a copy of Windows 10 running in a virtual machine.</description></item><item><title>Back to the drawing board</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/back-to-the-drawing-board/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/back-to-the-drawing-board/</guid><description>For the past couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out new things. New to me, anyway. And as you might expect, I&amp;rsquo;m really bad at them. Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about that!
Why did it have to be Moodle? I work in a very Microsoft-centric environment. The vast majority of our servers are Windows 2016, 2012 R2, and a few straggling 2008 R2 boxes which just refuse to die. Possibly for this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve never had a GNU/Linux technician.</description></item><item><title>A reluctant return to Windows</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/reluctant-return/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 May 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/reluctant-return/</guid><description>I have lived a Windows-free life for a good long while now, using the OS only at work and leaving my home setup free of Microsoftâ€™s influence. However, with the upcoming shift to Windows 10 in my place of work (which I will be helping to develop) and my need to study PowerShell and Hyper-V for my 70-410 exam, I decided to bite the bullet and once again load Windows 10 Professional on to my machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
