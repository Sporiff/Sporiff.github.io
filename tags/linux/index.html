Given that I started this tradition before I was particularly proficient with GNU/Linux and *BSD, I have usually taken to using Ubuntu as a crutch of sorts.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/into-the-void/><section><h2 class=title>Into the Void</h3><time datetime=2019-06-08>Jun 8, 2019</time><p>Ever heard of Void Linux? Me neither until a little while ago. My friend had originally introduced me to Void when I was looking at going back to Arch Linux a few years ago, stating that it was (in many ways) a vastly superior system. I was intrigued, but I ultimately ended up sticking with Arch as I was familiar with it and was unwilling to give up on using the AUR at that point.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/goodbye-guix/><section><h2 class=title>Goodbye, Guix</h3><time datetime=2019-02-04>Feb 4, 2019</time><p>So for the last few weeks I've been exclusively using GuixSD on my X200s. It's been an interesting experiment, and there are a good many things I really liked about the system. For now, though, I am going back to Parabola.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/elementary-juno/><section><h2 class=title>Elementary OS Juno</h3><time datetime=2018-10-22>Oct 22, 2018</time><p>Note: I have contributed translations to the Elementary OS project and have been an active Patreon supporter since April 2018. I don&rsquo;t think of myself as particularly biased, but it&rsquo;s best to mention these things
Summary (for those who don&rsquo;t want to read) I like Elementary OS. It does plenty right and offers a minimalist system with decent keyboard control, a healthy environment which encourages users to invest in developers, and it largely keeps out of my way while offering the power of Ubuntu under the hood.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/personal-matters/><section><h2 class=title>Personal matters</h3><time datetime=2018-10-01>Oct 1, 2018</time><p>This post is more of a rant than anything technical. In fact, it's more of a moan born of recent frustrations. Nevertheless, this is my website. Where better to moan?</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/back-to-the-drawing-board/><section><h2 class=title>Back to the drawing board</h3><time datetime=2018-06-15>Jun 15, 2018</time><p>For the past couple of weeks I've been trying out new things.

However, with the upcoming shift to Windows 10 in my place of work (which I will be helping to develop) and my need to study PowerShell and Hyper-V for my 70-410 exam, I decided to bite the bullet and once again load Windows 10 Professional on to my machine.</p></section></a><nav class=pagination></nav></body></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
