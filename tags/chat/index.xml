I&amp;rsquo;m not really a programmer by any stretch of the imagination (yet!) but was challenged to write a bot for a Matrix chatroom I frequent. Most of us have written bots already, so it was my time to try something.
Originally I had planned to use Python like I had done previously for my Mastodon bot, tsukumogami. However, I&amp;rsquo;d been hearing some interesting things about Rust and decided it would be a fun challenge to try and write something functional in the language.</description></item><item><title>Say no to Slack</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/say-no-to-slack/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/say-no-to-slack/</guid><description>My workplace uses Slack. Actually, let me rephrase that: some of my coworkers use Slack. The company for which I work has had some trouble committing properly to a communications platform, which has left us in something of a state of limbo when it comes to communicating with one another. Some people only use Slack, others only Skype, still more refuse to communicate by anything other than good old fashioned face-to-face or email.</description></item><item><title>Matrix is here</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/matrix-is-here/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/matrix-is-here/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about it beforeâ€¦ And it&amp;rsquo;s finally here! After much head scratching, frustration, and eventually the building of an entirely new server, my Matrix server garappa.chat is up and running. This has been something I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about doing for a while as I try to get away from all bigger services in favour of hosting my own. While Mastodon and Funkwhale where considerably easier to set up, I have a feeling it will be worth it in the end.</description></item></channel></rss>
