This was with the understanding that there would need to be a transition period while I trained my replacement (I work with a very big, poorly documented product, which means that training is a very big task), but that I could expect to be out of my current role within 6 months.
7 months later, we have not even appointed somebody to the new role.</description></item></channel></rss>
