I&amp;rsquo;ve never really been much of a hardware person, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest.

For this reason my computers have always been a bit off the mark; I will nearly always pick something over-specced or under-specced, something too big or something too small, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
