Wow. That's a pretty substantial break, but it does also coincide with the last time I had any time off work. So in a way it makes sense.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/in-defence-of-gnome-web/><section><h2 class=title>In defence of GNOME Web</h3><time datetime=2020-08-14>Aug 14, 2020</time><p>So you probably already know that Mozilla recently went bang and fired 25% of its workforce before announcing that whoops lol actually we are still going to be able to feed the hungry fox this year…</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/plan-9-fun/><section><h2 class=title>Plan 9 fun</h3><time datetime=2020-05-13>May 13, 2020</time><p>Just when I was worried I would never be able to have fun with computers again, along comes Plan 9.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/walled-gardens/><section><h2 class=title>Ditch the walled gardens</h3><time datetime=2020-05-07>May 7, 2020</time><p>Spotify is really just a symptom of a larger problem, but it's a nasty symptom we should treat.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/site-speed-improvements/><section><h2 class=title>Site speed improvements</h3><time datetime=2020-04-22>Apr 22, 2020</time><p>I got poking around at this site and was doing some thinking. Mainly along the lines of speed and security. By default, the dark-hyde theme provided by the good folks over at Coleslaw uses Google&rsquo;s CDN for font delivery. This is all well and good, however I&rsquo;m really not a big fan of Google at all and like to avoid them where possible. With that in mind, I started thinking about how I could go about replacing them.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/alpine/><section><h2 class=title>Alpine</h3><time datetime=2020-04-21>Apr 21, 2020</time><p>For a good long while now I've been hosting a bunch of different services across different servers.
