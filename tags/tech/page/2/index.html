As such (and given the long history of vendor lock-in and associated cost/challenge with going without the support of major tech companies), I have a pretty significant footprint with certain tech companies.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/into-the-void/><section><h2 class=title>Into the Void</h3><time datetime=2019-06-08>Jun 8, 2019</time><p>Ever heard of Void Linux? Me neither until a little while ago. My friend had originally introduced me to Void when I was looking at going back to Arch Linux a few years ago, stating that it was (in many ways) a vastly superior system. I was intrigued, but I ultimately ended up sticking with Arch as I was familiar with it and was unwilling to give up on using the AUR at that point.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/matrix-is-here/><section><h2 class=title>Matrix is here</h3><time datetime=2019-04-24>Apr 24, 2019</time><p>And it's finally here!

My partner frequently complains about apps on her phone being updated, only to find that entire sections of the UI have changed with seemingly no warning.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/apple-drink-the-cider/><section><h2 class=title>Apple: drink the cider</h3><time datetime=2018-10-05>Oct 5, 2018</time><p>Let me get this off my chest right now. I hate Apple. I hate iOS. I hate macOS. I hate the software, the hardware, and the ethos of Apple. To my mind, Apple represents the very worst of the technology industry: devices which are hard to use, easy to break, and difficult to fix. Therefore, I&rsquo;m never surprised when I see news stories like this one.
The long and short of this story is that Apple have implemented a new chip (the T2 chip) which can detect whether or not repairs to a broken machine have been carried out by a verified technician using a pre-configured pin code.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/personal-matters/><section><h2 class=title>Personal matters</h3><time datetime=2018-10-01>Oct 1, 2018</time><p>This post is more of a rant than anything technical. In fact, it's more of a moan born of recent frustrations. Nevertheless, this is my website. Where better to moan?</p></section></a><nav class=pagination><a class=previous href=/tags/tech/>Newer</a>
