After much head scratching, frustration, and eventually the building of an entirely new server, my Matrix server garappa.chat is up and running. This has been something I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about doing for a while as I try to get away from all bigger services in favour of hosting my own. While Mastodon and Funkwhale where considerably easier to set up, I have a feeling it will be worth it in the end.</description></item><item><title>Bring back my internet</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/bring-back-my-internet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/bring-back-my-internet/</guid><description>Mixed messages Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;m slightly reneging on my earlier post by writing about computers again, but trust me when I say this one is as much personal as it is technical.
Back in t' day It seems so bizarre to me that people are taken aback by my not having a Facebook account. Or a Twitter account. Or anything that they have bar email.
I&amp;rsquo;ll add you on Facebook.</description></item><item><title>Tanuki Tunes update</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/tanuki-tunes-update/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/tanuki-tunes-update/</guid><description>Another Funkwhale update After a little bit of frustration on my side due to not following the directions properly, Tanuki Tunes is now running Funkwhale 0.18.1. The changes in this version will be mostly invisible to end-users, but include important bugfixes such as one that prevented the editing of tracks in the Django admin panel. This update has also made me aware that the site was previously running an out-of-date version of Postgresql.</description></item><item><title>Baku Social news</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/baku-social-news/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/baku-social-news/</guid><description>Technical updates So it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit of a busy month for Baku Social. The server experienced some minor downtime at the end of December owing to high memory usage, however there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been anything breeching the limits since then so fingers crossed there is no need yet to upgrade the specs of the VPS itself. I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to monitor it to ensure that nothing goes overboard, but given the low traffic both it and Tanuki Tunes seem to be managing fine for the moment.</description></item><item><title>Baku Social</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/baku-social/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/baku-social/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a project recently to teach me some more about various technologies, specifically public cloud stuff like AWS and container tech like Docker. I have been looking to get into this stuff for a little while and even previously hosted on of my blogs on a container OS, but that was shortlived due to too many headaches with Wordpress containers. For the last few months I had also been looking for a way to replace Spotify – which I had left behind due to privacy concerns, costs, and library limitations (I listen to some… weird stuff).</description></item></channel></rss>
