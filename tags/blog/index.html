This was with the understanding that there would need to be a transition period while I trained my replacement, but that I could expect to be out of my current role within 6 months…</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2020/site-speed-improvements/><section><h2 class=title>Site speed improvements</h3><time datetime=2020-04-22>Apr 22, 2020</time><p>I got poking around at this site and was doing some thinking. Mainly along the lines of speed and security. By default, the dark-hyde theme provided by the good folks over at Coleslaw uses Google&rsquo;s CDN for font delivery. This is all well and good, however I&rsquo;m really not a big fan of Google at all and like to avoid them where possible. With that in mind, I started thinking about how I could go about replacing them.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/coleslaw-migration/><section><h2 class=title>Coleslaw migration</h3><time datetime=2019-11-02>Nov 2, 2019</time><p>I've recently started learning to use Emacs after leaving the Emacs manual lying around for the better part of a year. Since I've decided to try my hand at some common lisp I figured it would be a good time to start learning, and my goodness I wish I'd started this sooner.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/into-the-void/><section><h2 class=title>Into the Void</h3><time datetime=2019-06-08>Jun 8, 2019</time><p>Ever heard of Void Linux? Me neither until a little while ago. My friend had originally introduced me to Void when I was looking at going back to Arch Linux a few years ago, stating that it was (in many ways) a vastly superior system. I was intrigued, but I ultimately ended up sticking with Arch as I was familiar with it and was unwilling to give up on using the AUR at that point.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/moving-to-sphinx/><section><h2 class=title>Moving to Sphinx</h3><time datetime=2019-05-08>May 8, 2019</time><p>I've made a few changes to this website. Well, not really a few changes, more like a complete overhaul. I was getting a bit bored of using Hugo/Markdown and decided to challenge myself to using Sphinx and rST instead.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/new-developments/><section><h2 class=title>New developments</h3><time datetime=2019-04-17>Apr 17, 2019</time><p>It&rsquo;s been a little while Every time I have a blog I am always really bad at posting to it consistently. Actually, a lot has changed in recent months so I thought I&rsquo;d do a little brain dump.
Funkwhale Thanks to the lovely people at Funkwhale I&rsquo;m finally getting involved properly with a software project. To date I&rsquo;ve provided a couple of new (extremely simple) features and bugfixes, as well as leading a large project to restructure the documentation and provide a slew of new user guides.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/progress/><section><h2 class=title>Progress</h3><time datetime=2019-02-11>Feb 11, 2019</time><p>It feels good to actually have a positive impact on something.
