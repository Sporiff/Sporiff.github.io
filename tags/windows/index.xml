In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s more of a moan born of recent frustrations. Nevertheless, this is my website. Where better to moan?
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started a new job working for a software company. My day-to-day work mostly includes rifling through SQL databases and making changes as well as searching for causes of issues faced by customers.

Are you prepared for the pain? The lack of documentation? The feeling of utter exasperation at a company unable to properly consider the needs of enterprise customers in their new &amp;ldquo;modern&amp;rdquo; approach? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m here to share my experiences with you so that hopefully you can avoid some of the pain I had to go through in getting this all ready for our upcoming rollout.</description></item><item><title>Some more Windows work</title><link>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/some-more-windows-work/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sporiff.github.io/posts/some-more-windows-work/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a little while since I last posted here.

However, with the upcoming shift to Windows 10 in my place of work (which I will be helping to develop) and my need to study PowerShell and Hyper-V for my 70-410 exam, I decided to bite the bullet and once again load Windows 10 Professional on to my machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
