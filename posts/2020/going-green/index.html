It seems so strange to me that they don&rsquo;t see that this is a really big draw, especially in the tech industry where at least 70% of us are weird hippies. The other day I decided to do a little research on my host&rsquo;s (DigitalOcean) offerings and the differences between the data center, and I was surprised to find out the following:</p><ol><li>DO does not have an easily accessible page about the green status of their data centers</li><li>Only one of their data centers is easily verifiable as green (FRA1)</li></ol><p>Now, judging by <a href=https://www.madebymutual.com/blog/is-digitalocean-green-hosting/>this post</a> the majority of DO&rsquo;s European hosting is fully green (including London, though for privacy reasons I would wholeheartedly and emphatically dissuade you from hosting anything at all in the UK if you can possibly avoid it). But trawling through the forums shows a lot of umming and ahing on DO&rsquo;s part and a seeming unwillingness to be transparent and straightforward with users about the state of their energy sources.</p><p>Of course, users can go to the hosting providers directly to find out more information, but it really would be better for DO to be up-front and honest about these things from the get-go. If, for example, somebody chose to host their services/data in the SF data centers, they may be disappointed to learn that these run on only 30% renewable energy and may look to use a different region. Certainly, this would have swayed my decision when setting up my servers.</p><p>Currently, my Matrix server and website are both hosted in FRA1, as are all of my spaces. I&rsquo;m thinking of migrating my other services (Funkwhale and Mastodon) from AMS3 to FRA1 as well, if only to reward <a href=https://www.interxion.com/why-interxion/sustainability/>interxion</a> for being so up-front and reliable with their renewables.</p><p>tl;dr, DO sort your shit out and put green ratings on your regions at selection.</p></article></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
