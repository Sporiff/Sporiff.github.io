<a class=tag href=tags/travel>travel</a></aside></div><br><br><p>Things have been a bit busy this past month. As well as getting vaccinated and finally securing my visa appointment, I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot at work. This month saw the release of our new help center, to which I contributed my first SDK documentation. I&rsquo;ve had to sit down and learn Swift, Objective-C, and Java to get this out the door. It&rsquo;s been a bit of an adventure!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also been socialising more, especially important since I&rsquo;ll be moving away soon. It&rsquo;s been so nice to catch up with people and keep in more constant contact. Here&rsquo;s hoping the govt. lifts the Covid restrictions soon. It&rsquo;ll be nice to have a proper big gathering of friends.</p><p>In more tech-related news I&rsquo;ve recently been testing out the new Windows 11 release. I&rsquo;ll write up my thoughts in a bit more detail soon, but suffice to say it&rsquo;s a good upgrade. I&rsquo;m looking forward to what Microsoft is able to make of it over the next few months. Animations are a little janky (still), but it&rsquo;s obvious that they&rsquo;re taking a lot of care over the interface.</p><p>All things being equal, I&rsquo;m hoping to be able to make my move to Germany in September. I&rsquo;ll be applying for my visa in London next week and getting my second jab in August. If Mutti Merkel doesn&rsquo;t decide to shut me out, I should be able to go shortly after. I&rsquo;m excited and terrified about moving, but it&rsquo;s going to be a good change. I haven&rsquo;t lived abroad in over 7 years at this point and England is definitely <em>grating</em> on me. It seems that the country is getting less agreeable every day. Even glancing at the news or social feeds is enough to instill rage in me.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also aiming to get back to work on Funkwhale over the next few weeks. Due to work I&rsquo;ve had to step back from my ongoing merge requests, but now that it&rsquo;s calmed down I&rsquo;d like to finish. There are some exciting visual changes and important security upgrades coming. Here&rsquo;s to making 1.2 a great release!</p><p>Bis bald, Deutschland!</p></article></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
