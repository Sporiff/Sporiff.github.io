<source src=https://rootkey.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/static/images/Soap%20Calculator.webm type=video/webm>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video><p>I&rsquo;ve been having some fun learning Python recently as part of a course I&rsquo;m doing. One of our early assignments was to create a simple saponification calculator which would return the amount of lye and water required to make soap from some given oils.</p><p>My personal goal in all of this is to be able to make graphical programs, as I always seem to fall at that hurdle. I&rsquo;ve made terminal-based scripts and apps in the past, but have always given up with the creation of a GUI due to not understanding how on earth you get a front-end to talk to a back-end.</p><p>After spending some time with <a href=https://glade.gnome.org/>Glade</a> and the excellent <a href=https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/>GTK developer documentation</a> (and by time I mean I started this rewrite at 7PM and ended up with something workable at 7AM), I am finally getting a handle on how these things talk to one another and work together.</p><p>Something I&rsquo;d never really considered was just how different interacting with applications in the terminal and on the front-end is. With a terminal app things are fairly sequential and predictable, but when you start putting things into an interface it becomes a completely different process. The <a href=https://github.com/Sporiff/soap-calculator/tree/ae2bca34dd2dbae7db4f31d7e45e44b8597b5df9/soap_calculator.py>original script</a> essentially just ran through each part in sequence:</p><ul><li>Enter a value for olive oil</li><li>Enter a value for coconut oil</li><li>Select whether or not to use lye reduction</li><li>Calculate results</li></ul><p>But with a GUI application, it&rsquo;s possible to have all of the inputs accessible at once, and the expectation of the user will be to have either:</p><ul><li>A button that performs the calculation once everything is filled in</li><li>A calculation performed whenever a value is changed</li></ul><p>For the challenge of it, I opted for the latter, which meant that at every turn entries had to be sanitized and handled synchronously. What I had originally thought would be a simple case of just attaching a front end to a script basically left me with a completely different program with a different project structure and set of tools. The only thing that remained consistent was the maths.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about Python recently, to the point where I&rsquo;m starting to think about work projects in terms of how they could be simplified using the language. The important thing, I think, is to make sure I know ahead of time whether I expect to use a GUI or not, as it has a massive impact on how everything is set up.</p><p>I will say that there is a relatively small amount of documentation available for Python + Glade, and a lot of the documentation that is available is aging badly (Python 2.7, anyone?). However, a lot of the blanks can be filled in by reading documentation for Glade and other languages like C and Vala to get an idea of how the elements interact with the language, then simply convert that to your Python thinking.</p><p>Is my code good? No. It badly needs to be refactored and cleaned up. But for a 12-hour sprint with a tool I&rsquo;ve never used before I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it. Of course, the moment I use it on a different DE the theming falls apart but oh well…</p><p>Next up: learning how to package this stuff.</p><p><a href=https://github.com/Sporiff/soap-calculator>Source code</a></p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/blog/>blog</a></span>
