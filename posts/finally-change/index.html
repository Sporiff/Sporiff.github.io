<p>The last time I posted anything here was August 2020. Wow. That&rsquo;s a pretty substantial break, but it does also coincide with the last time I had any time off work. So in a way it makes sense.</p>
<p>A lot has happened since then, but the biggest thing for me personally is that I have taken a job opportunity out in Germany. I&rsquo;ve been trying to get out of the UK for a while now, so to have finally managed to secure an opportunity is pretty huge for me. I&rsquo;m switching careers from programming to technical writing. It strikes me I&rsquo;ve always had more of an interest in explaining <em>how</em> things are achieved than actually <em>achieving</em> them myself, so it&rsquo;s a pretty good fit.</p>
<p>Obviously, the world is in the middle of a plague right now so my physical move isn&rsquo;t going to happen for a little while, but I have officially left my old position and been set up with IT accounts etc. at my new one, so it&rsquo;s all a go from here. I&rsquo;ll be starting my new job remotely on Monday, so I&rsquo;m pretty excited to get stuck in.</p>
<p>After a week off, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m incredibly excited about starting a new life in Berlin. The last year has been a particularly tough one for me personally after my relationship broke down and I am feeling the need for change very keenly. I&rsquo;ve also been making efforts to reconnect with old friends with whom I had stopped talking to try and keep myself in the loop. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be the asshole&rdquo; is my new mantra.</p>
<h2 id=some-smaller-life-changes>Some smaller life changes</h2>
<p>Of course, with a new life comes new hardware. Since I am switching my focus back to writing I decided it was high time I invest in a normal laptop. You know, one that&rsquo;s actually <em>portable</em> and can sit on your lap. For several years I&rsquo;ve been using a 17" gaming laptop which is neither really a gaming machine nor a laptop as it has the portability and power of a poor desktop. I&rsquo;ve now handed this device to my dad so he has a bigger screen to watch his Chinese dramas on.</p>
<p>For my sins, I opted for an ultrabook after much debate. I&rsquo;ve learned my lesson about investing in cheap hardware and decided to go for a top-of-the-line Dell XPS 13. This is a lovely little device and, despite needing a lot of fiddling to get it set up the way I like, I&rsquo;m enjoying it as a portable workstation (however, who the <em>hell</em> decided two USB-C ports was all a laptop needed?).</p>
<h2 id=having-fun-with-windows>Having fun with Windows</h2>
<p>In preparation to hand my old machine to my dad, I installed Windows 10 on the device again and have been having a shufti at how the old system is going. From the looks of things, a huge amount has improved. The Windows Store continues to be a colossal waste of my time, but the new <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli>package manager</a> has made a huge difference (and did back <a href=https://keivan.io/the-day-appget-died/>Keivan Beigi originally made it</a>). I&rsquo;ve even been contributing packages for it <a href=https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs>on Github</a> just for gits and shiggles. It&rsquo;s great being able to install apps on the command line just like in a proper OS.</p>
<p>Other than that, Windows continues to be a fairly stable and reliable experience. The machine runs well with it and the terminal functionality combined with WSL mean that I&rsquo;m able to do all of my Linux shenanigans in one place with all the comfort of the world&rsquo;s most widely supported OS.</p>
<p>Git for Windows still sucks, but what can you do?</p>
<p>I may write up a full review of the XPS 13 towards the end of the week once I&rsquo;ve had some time to get to grips with it.</p>
