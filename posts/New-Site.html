<p>As the astute among you may have noticed, this site has undergone some changes
over the last couple of days. That's because I've now completely moved away
from Wordpress and destroyed my old server in favour of a different provider.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The server was costing me money that I didn't have to spare</li>
<li>Wordpress is slow and cumbersome. Even a simple site like this was taking
   far too long to load</li>
<li>I wasn't <em>learning</em> anything by using Wordpress</li>
</ol>

<p>This last point is the reason I've moved to the solution I have. I'm now using
<a href="https://netlify.com" >Netlify</a> in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com" >GitHub</a>
to host my site and am writing everything in Markdown to be generated using
<a href="https://gohugo.io" >Hugo</a>. Why? Well, let's take each of these points in turn.</p>

<p>Firstly, I've been thinking about getting away from Wordpress for a while now. 
Secondly, while I have a few repos on GitHub, I am not exactly a
git aficionado and really need to learn more for future reference. Thirdly,
writing posts in WYSIWYG editors is just kind of a crutch at this point. Now
that I'm spending more time getting to know Vim and LaTeX for home use, I feel
like getting to know Markdown at the same time is a good idea. Lastly, I am
just as guilty as many others of running a simple site with far too heavy an
interface. There is no justification for a blog such as mine to run on WP when
static pages will suffice.</p>

<p>I'm also going to be focusing more on RSS as this is a technology I would
dearly like to keep alive. I know not everybody likes it, but as somebody who
is finding themselves more and more living in a terminal it is an essential
thing for me.</p>

<p>That's all for now. Hopefully this move isn't too jarring. If you prefer light
themes, the lightbulb in the top right will switch you over. This site is dark
by default because it's better for your eyes, yung'uns</p>
