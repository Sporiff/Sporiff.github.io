This is usually my struggle. I am the sort of person who learns by doing, but until I have a need to do something I can&rsquo;t bring myself to learn.</p><p>Following on from my <a href=/posts/2018/elementary-juno/>previous post</a> I have been using the latest release of elementaryOS for the last few days and having a poke around at their documentation. I&rsquo;ve been really impressed by the relative simplicity of approach applications seem to have on the OS and the documentation. Having followed through a bit, it looks like the ideal platform for me to actually try and make my first app on.</p><p>The app will not be complicated (obviously). The idea is to combine two short programs I&rsquo;ve written previously: a simple Vala/GTK app written along with an elementary guide and a C program I wrote a while back to translate temperatures between °C, °F, and K. Since I already have the basic calculations written out for this, I don&rsquo;t need to worry too much about the maths (which is my greatest foe).</p><p>Instead I want to focus on UX and UI, specifically with regards to how the app deals with input and output of text. I know exactly what the app to look like and how I want it to work, the trick is going to be tying together all the bits and pieces while also trying to teach myself enough Vala + GTK to make it look like it does in my head.</p><p>This is just a post jotting down thoughts and the like. Obviously, this is going to take me a while since I&rsquo;m completely lacking in experience. Just thought I&rsquo;d post something lest I forget to do the damn thing.</p><p>As a quick update, I&rsquo;ve added thermy to my <a href=https://github.com/Sporiff/thermy>GitHub</a> as (very much) a WIP. As the app is updated when I have time to spare I&rsquo;ll push it straight there. Wouldn&rsquo;t expect too much, though.</p></article></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
