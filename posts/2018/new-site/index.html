That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve now completely moved away from Wordpress and destroyed my old server in favour of a different provider.</p><p>There are a couple of reasons for this:</p><ol><li>The server was costing me money that I didn&rsquo;t have to spare</li><li>Wordpress is slow and cumbersome. Even a simple site like this was taking
far too long to load</li><li>I wasn&rsquo;t <em>learning</em> anything by using Wordpress</li></ol><p>This last point is the reason I&rsquo;ve moved to the solution I have. I&rsquo;m now using <a href=https://netlify.com>Netlify</a> in conjunction with <a href=https://github.com>GitHub</a> to host my site and am writing everything in Markdown to be generated using <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a>. Why? Well, let&rsquo;s take each of these points in turn.</p><p>Firstly, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about getting away from Wordpress for a while now. Secondly, while I have a few repos on GitHub, I am not exactly a git aficionado and really need to learn more for future reference. Thirdly, writing posts in WYSIWYG editors is just kind of a crutch at this point. Now that I&rsquo;m spending more time getting to know Vim and LaTeX for home use, I feel like getting to know Markdown at the same time is a good idea. Lastly, I am just as guilty as many others of running a simple site with far too heavy an interface. There is no justification for a blog such as mine to run on WP when static pages will suffice.</p><p>I&rsquo;m also going to be focusing more on RSS as this is a technology I would dearly like to keep alive. I know not everybody likes it, but as somebody who is finding themselves more and more living in a terminal it is an essential thing for me.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all for now. Hopefully this move isn&rsquo;t too jarring. If you prefer light themes, the lightbulb in the top right will switch you over. This site is dark by default because it&rsquo;s better for your eyes, yung&rsquo;uns</p></article></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
