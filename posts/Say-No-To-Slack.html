<p>My workplace uses Slack. Actually, let me rephrase that: some
of my coworkers use Slack. The company for which I work has had
some trouble committing properly to a communications platform,
which has left us in something of a state of limbo when it comes
to communicating with one another. Some people only use Slack,
others only Skype, still more refuse to communicate by anything
other than good old fashioned face-to-face or email.</p>

<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I like instant messaging. Or more specifically
I <strong>don't</strong> like face-to-face or phone-based conversations. I
am much less efficient at talking than I am at writing and am
much more likely to make mistakes when talking to someone than
when I have a bit of time to think about what I want to say. Email,
the ultimate in asynchronous communications, is possibly my favourite
way of communicating as it gives all parties involved the headspace
to give a thoughtful response. There is nothing more irritating than
a one word or one sentence email such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>lol thanks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you help me with something?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or even the dreaded</p>

<blockquote>
<p>:-)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This kind of vapidity has little place in email for me. I tend
to get quite frustrated with this kind of thing, so I actually welcome
an instant messaging solution as a nice in-between for these types
of communication. People can have quick and meaningful exchanges
on these platforms which allow them to better determine whether they
can resolve what they need to resolve now or whether they should
use another form of communication.</p>

<p>However, I cannot abide Slack.</p>

<p>Slack represents the worst of office communications wrapped up in
a frustrating, ugly, and resource-intensive application. I dread
having to open it every morning, and whenever I do have to open it
to respond to the message I've just been informed about via email
(figure that one out) it sounds like my poor work MacBook is about
to take off to fight the Germans above Britain.</p>

<p>But Slack is not just technically frustrating: it represents a
dangerous trend away from what is important in the workplace. Most
messages outside of my team come in the form of &quot;hilarious&quot; GIFs
and links to local news articles with humorous titles. That these
exist in the same space as live communications about downtime and
discussions about bugfixes just feels very wrong to me.</p>

<h2>Slacking Off</h2>

<p>I am of the belief that people need to stop filling their time at
work. If you have nothing to do for whatever reason, you should be
allowed to stop working and do something else. After all, you are
being paid and not doing anything for the company either way, so
you may as well be allowed to go and do whatever.</p>

<p>However, that is not the world in which we live and as such we see
a lot of &quot;look busy-isms&quot; in the workplace. Nowhere is this more
prevalent than on the company Slack channels. Slack's all-too-eager-
to-please-non-technicals nature has led to it being bundled with a
whole deluge of distracting, network-intensive and irritating add-ons
which not only have nothing to do with the majority of jobs but are
downright distracting when they pop up.</p>

<p>Slack also has, of course, a whole plethora of very useful features,
though I am yet to see them properly utilised in a busines environment.
Threaded messages, for example, are designed to reduce the clutter
in the main chat and allow conversations to be kept together out of
the way. But this isn't how other messengers such as Facebook
Messenger and Skype work, and as such these see limited adoption from
(I would guess) the majority of users. I've seen the <code>/gifs</code> integration
get a lot of hammer, though. Very useful feature.</p>

<p>Now, I'm coming off as a curmudgeon here, but please understand that
I'm not trying to say nobody should have fun at work. What I'm trying
to say is that playing about on Slack when you have no work to do is
not only counterproductive in the long-term (making it seem as though
everybody is always working is a sure-fire way to keep people in offices
for long days because <strong>clearly</strong> we all have a lot to do), it's also
downright irritating for the rest of us. I often just quit Slack to
A) silence these notifications and B) save my poor, poor Macbook from
the threat of Electron. Then I find out I missed an important message.
Damnit.</p>

<h2>Use Better</h2>

<p>As I said above, I am generally a fan of instant messaging. I make
use of <a href="https://matrix.org" >Matrix</a> every day and spent the majority of my youth on IRC.
To this day I sit most of the time in chatrooms be they for discussing
software production, offering support, or shooting the shit with my
old university pals. I don't want to see IM disappear from the workplace,
but I certainly want to see Slack pulled.</p>

<p>Slack is <em>expensive</em>. At nearly six dollars per user per month it's
a really bank account-unfriendly way of allowing coworkers to share
gifs and vapid articles. It's also (brace yourselves) <em>non-free software</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The crowd gasps in shock and horror</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I know, it's not a concern to most. But be forewarned: Slack is
a variety of ransomware. Its free trial allows you to make full use
of its features before it starts trying to extort you to get your data
back. If you run a business, <strong>do not</strong> give your data to these thugs.
Keep your data safe and accessible by using open alternatives such as
Matrix, Mattermost, or even the venerable IRC. You can't go wrong with
the classics.</p>
