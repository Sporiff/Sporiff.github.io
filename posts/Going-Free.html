<p>I've been working with and enjoying technology most of my life. As
such (and given the long history of vendor lock-in and associated
cost/challenge with going without the support of major tech companies),
I have a pretty significant footprint with certain tech companies.
I've been with Google/Gmail/Android for many years. I have files
stored up on Onedrive and Google Cloud. I have been working with
Windows, ChromeOS, and even macOS and iOS at various stages as long
as I have been working with computers. After some self-education I've
come to the conclusion that these dependencies must end and have
been on a path to rid myself of external influences.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing list of issues I've come across and alternatives
found. This is by no means a comprehensive list; this is more just
a few examples of alternatives I've been able to fill the holes with.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p><img src="https://assets.rootkey.co.uk/static/images/weechat.png" alt="Matrix running in weechat" /></p>

<p>It's an unfortunate reality that communication platforms are among
the hardest things to abandon. After all, your friends and family
have probably come to depend on them despite telling you years ago
that such channels of communication were &quot;not as good as a phone
call&quot;. Facebook, Twitter, and others know this all too well, and
try to buy up the landscape around them in order to ensure that
you can't go too far outside of their sphere of influence even if
you &quot;cancel&quot; your main account.</p>

<p>I've cancelled Facebook at least twice at this point. The first
time was a few years back after a mental break that saw me re-evaluating
how I interacted with the internet in general. More recently, though,
I simply decided to leave. I don't like Facebook as a company or
as a product, so it seemed silly to stick around using it. Twitter
was a little harder to give up on, but eventually I moved away in favour
of my own <a href="https://bakusocial.com" >Mastodon server</a>.</p>

<p>For chat, <a href="https://matrix.org" >Matrix</a> seems to be the ideal candidate to take
over from proprietary solutions. I tend to use this with Weechat,
but the more glossy clients such as <a href="https://riot.im" >Riot</a> and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal" >Fractal</a> 
are also available for people not so inclined to use a terminal application.</p>

<h2>Productivity</h2>

<p>Productivity is generally less of an issue in my experience, as
productivity tools are almost invariably superior in the free
software world and it is not a requirement that everybody use the
same monolithic tools in order to work with each other in every
case. I personally can get most of what I need to do done with Vim,
Pandoc, LaTeX, and git.</p>

<p>The area with which I do struggle sometimes is audio/video production.
While there are some excellent tools for these, I have come across quite
a few issues with hooking equipment up to a GNU/Linux powered machine
and not having access to its full range of features. It's a shame,
as it's not the fault of the software developers as much as the OEMs.
Most things are designed explicitly for Windows or macOS in these fields,
but it is encouraging to see so much work going in to it on the GNU/Linux
and *BSD worlds.</p>

<h2>Entertainment</h2>

<p>Gaming on Linux has improved significantly with the release of Steam's
Proton. However, while this is an impressive piece of technology, it is
nonetheless keeping you locked in to a specific company and denying you
the freedom to do with your games as you will. Luckily, I don't play games
on my computer much.</p>

<p>I've been able to replace Soundcloud/Spotify/Google Play Music with
<a href="https://funkwhale.audio" >Funkwhale</a> and have enjoyed being able to run this with the 
<a href="https://github.com/Prior99/mopidy-subidy" >mopidy-subidy</a> plugin on my machine.</p>
