<h2>I've Talked About it Before...</h2>

<p>And it's finally here! After much head scratching, frustration, and
eventually the building of an entirely new server, my Matrix server
<a href="https://riot.garappa.chat" >garappa.chat</a> is up and running. This
has been something I've talked about doing for a while as I try to
get away from all bigger services in favour of hosting my own. While
<a href="https://bakusocial.com/about" >Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://tanukitunes.com" >Funkwhale</a>
where considerably easier to set up, I have a feeling it will be worth it
in the end.</p>

<h2>This Was a Fight</h2>

<p>For as long as I've used <a href="https://matrix.org" >Matrix</a> I have used
the flagship server due to how prohibitively difficult it seemed to
be to set up a <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse.html" >synapse server</a>
Having tried setting the server up as both a Docker container and a
native set of applications on the same server as the other two services,
I eventually conceded that I was going to need a clean sheet for this
one.</p>

<p>So to <a href="https://digitalocean.com" >DO</a> we go to spin up a new VPS for
my new whim. As I sat about getting the server itself ready for yet another
Docker fight I decided to do some reading on other people's struggles
with Synapse and what could be done about it. The results were pretty
discouraging, with many people hitting quite significant dead-ends and
being unable to fix the issue before their patience ran out. However,
while looking into other server options I chanced upon a certain
<a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy" >Ansible Playbook</a>...</p>

<p>Having never used Ansible before I started doing some poking around.
In my first run I tried running it from the server as I was pretty
much clueless when it came to what Ansible was or how it was supposed
to work. After a while, though, I started to see some results. With
each new parameter passed I was seeing features added. With one last
push this morning I finally got S3 media uploads working, which should
hopefully help some with storage costs. Now I want to use Ansible for
everything. Whoops!</p>

<h2>Less Exciting News</h2>

<p>With all that excitement here is a bit of less important but still
fun news: this website will be written in <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html" >rST</a>
instead of Markdown. The reason for this is trivial, but still important.
rST is a proper standard and a really pleasing way to write documents.
I can be confident that what I write in one place will render the same
elsewhere in a way I can't always be with Markdown. MD is still
one of my favourite tools and I use it extensively at work, but for
now I'm going to focus my efforts more on mastering reStructuredText
for my work with <a href="https://funkwhale.audio" >the Funkwhale project</a></p>

<h2>A Worthy Note</h2>

<p>As an aside, I have been having a fantastic time interacting with the
FW community. A more supportive group of people I couldn't wish to know.
The project keeps exceeding my expectations and the people involved show
a real interest in improving the community and the level of interaction,
which as a novice programmer is really encouraging to see.</p>
