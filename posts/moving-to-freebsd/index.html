Before, this site was hosted on the same server that currently hosts my Mastodon instance and Funkwhale pod, as well as my git server. But with gitea&rsquo;s poor performance and the general overcrowding, mixed in with my recent winding down of my Streama server, I decided to make a completely new server for
my website.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of playing around with <a href=https://freebsd.org>FreeBSD</a> lately as part of my never-ending quest to find the ideal operating system. There are some things I absolutely love about the system, and its minimalist setup and hardy security defaults made it the ideal candidate to set my website up on.</p><p>The initial install was incredibly easy, although I made some mistakes initially with the installation of my SSH key. DO&rsquo;s FreeBSD offering is considerably more hardened than their Debian/Ubuntu ones as they require an SSH key be set up and do not allow the management of root passwords. This suits me just fine as I never use a root password if I can possibly avoid it. A fully featured <code>wheel</code> account is good enough for me.</p><p>After getting everything set up nice, my next adventure came with Nginx. I&rsquo;m so used now to setting up sites and web apps using nginx on Debian-based systems that I can do it in my sleep, but the difference in layout/defaults for Nginx on FreeBSD gave me pause for thought. Once I got into the swing of it, it made a lot of sense and felt a lot more suited to smaller setups, but the initial confusion was somewhat annoying. Not the system&rsquo;s fault in any way (RTFM and all that), but still a puzzler.</p><p>Then I decided to be an idiot. See, DO supplies a default <code>FreeBSD</code> account which is installed with your keys. This account has full root access using <code>sudo</code> and is meant to be used for access and maintenance of the server. But I&rsquo;m an odd fellow, so I really wanted to set my account up to better match my other machines. I installed <code>zsh</code> and decided to <code>chsh</code> my account to change my username and shell. All went well, I moved my home folder and then left the shell to load my new shell. Everything loaded fine, but suddenly my site stopped working. Ah, I realised too late that of course the site is just a symlink from a folder in my home folder, which has now moved. Whoops. I&rsquo;ll just move that b-</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span style=display:flex><span>sporiff is not in the sudoers file
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you change your username, make sure you also change your sudoers file. Fool.</p><p>Anyway, it was easy enough to get everything torn down and built back up. I&rsquo;ve now got the server all up-to-date and automated and I must say I&rsquo;m pretty happy with its performance so far. It hasn&rsquo;t got a big job, but it&rsquo;s a job I&rsquo;m glad I chose FreeBSD to do.</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/blog/>blog</a></span>
