I hate Apple. I hate iOS. I hate macOS. I hate the software, the hardware, and the ethos of Apple. To my mind, Apple represents the very worst of the technology industry: devices which are hard to use, easy to break, and difficult to fix. Therefore, I&rsquo;m never surprised when I see news stories like this one.
The long and short of this story is that Apple have implemented a new chip (the T2 chip) which can detect whether or not repairs to a broken machine have been carried out by a verified technician using a pre-configured pin code.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/personal-matters/><section><h2 class=title>Personal matters</h3><time datetime=2018-10-01>Oct 1, 2018</time><p>This post is more of a rant than anything technical. In fact, it's more of a moan born of recent frustrations. Nevertheless, this is my website. Where better to moan?</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/new-site/><section><h2 class=title>New site</h3><time datetime=2018-09-30>Sep 30, 2018</time><p>As the astute among you may have noticed, this site has undergone some changes over the last couple of days. That's because I've now completely moved away from Wordpress and destroyed my old server in favour of a different provider.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/deploying-controlling-chrome-intune/><section><h2 class=title>Deploying and controlling Google Chrome settings using Microsoft Intune</h3><time datetime=2018-07-26>Jul 26, 2018</time><p>Righto. This one has given me a mild headache for the last couple of days, but I've found a workable solution that allows me to set a home page for users in Chrome. You would have thought that would be really easy, right? Well, Google in its infinite wisdom has decided that conventional Windows management is for wusses. So down the rabbit hole we go</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/teams-deployment-headaches/><section><h2 class=title>Microsoft Teams deployment headaches</h3><time datetime=2018-07-13>Jul 13, 2018</time><p>So you want to use Microsoft Teams in your organisation, huh? Are you prepared for the pain? The lack of documentation? The feeling of utter exasperation at a company unable to properly consider the needs of enterprise customers in their new "modern" approach?</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/back-to-the-drawing-board/><section><h2 class=title>Back to the drawing board</h3><time datetime=2018-06-15>Jun 15, 2018</time><p>For the past couple of weeks I've been trying out new things. New to me, anyway. And as you might expect, I'm really bad at them. Let's talk about that!</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/some-more-windows-work/><section><h2 class=title>Some more Windows work</h3><time datetime=2018-06-01>Jun 1, 2018</time><p>It's been a little while since I last posted here. I've been having a very busy and productive time at work. Let's jump in to some of the stuff I've learned over the past couple of weeks. Come on! It'll be fun!</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2018/knit-and-perl/><section><h2 class=title>Knit and Perl</h3><time datetime=2018-05-14>May 14, 2018</time><p>I mostly seem to hang out with coders.

However, with the upcoming shift to Windows 10 in my place of work (which I will be helping to develop) and my need to study PowerShell and Hyper-V for my 70-410 exam, I decided to bite the bullet and once again load Windows 10 Professional on to my machine.</p></section></a><nav class=pagination><a class=previous href=/posts/page/4/>Newer</a>
