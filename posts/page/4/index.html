It's been an interesting experiment, and there are a good many things I really liked about the system. For now, though, I am going back to Parabola.</p></section></a><a class=entry href=/posts/2019/more-writing/><section><h2 class=title>More writing</h3><time datetime=2019-02-03>Feb 3, 2019</time><p>I've been writing posts on this website for a little while now, mostly relating to my technological exploits and sysadmin misadventures.

It does plenty right and offers a minimalist system with decent keyboard control, a healthy environment which encourages users to invest in developers, and it largely keeps out of my way while offering the power of Ubuntu under the hood.</p></section></a><nav class=pagination><a class=previous href=/posts/page/3/>Newer</a>
