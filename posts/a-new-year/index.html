All is not, however, doom and gloom.</p><h2 id=funky-friends>Funky friends</h2><p>Back in February of 2019 I started committing to <a href=https://funkwhale.audio>Funkwhale</a>. Initially I contributed only documentation, but as I spent more time with the application I started to get more involved with the codebase. I now regularly contribute small fixes and improvements, and I even sit on the association&rsquo;s steering committee.</p><p>Participating in Funkwhale has been an incredibly rewarding experience which I hope to keep going for as long as possible. In February, a whole year on from the start of my engagement with the project, I will be travelling to meet the collected association members in person!</p><h2 id=hosting-hijinks>Hosting hijinks</h2><p>Of course, 2019 was also the year that I got fully stuck into hosting my own services. While <a href=https://tanukitunes.com>Tanuki Tunes</a> and <a href=https://bakusocial.com>Baku Social</a> were technically spun up in December 2018, they didn&rsquo;t really start to see any traction until much later. I now host 4 public services (Mastodon, Funkwhale, <a href=https://gitsune.site>Gitea</a>, and <a href=https://riot.garappa.chat>Matrix</a>) and a private <a href=https://streamaservice.org>Streama</a> instance for me and my dad. I had always been interested in self hosting, and I have to admit that I very much enjoy the challenge it presents. Tanuki Tunes has been particularly popular, gaining over 200 users over the course of the year :tada:</p><h2 id=hopes-for-the-future>Hopes for the future</h2><p>I was recently given a new job, which will mean that I will be transitioning out of my current reactive support role and into a more constructive technical account management role. While not the development role I was hoping to get (in order to help me improve my coding knowledge), this role should leave me with more time to work on projects, better pay, and a chance to actually work a standard shift for once. No more tickets! No more tickets!</p><p>That is, of course, if the UK doesn&rsquo;t decide to completely tear itself apart over the next year…</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/blog/>blog</a></span>
