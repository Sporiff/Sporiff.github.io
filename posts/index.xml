Summary (for those who don&amp;rsquo;t want to read) I like Elementary OS. It does plenty right and offers a minimalist system with decent keyboard control, a healthy environment which encourages users to invest in developers, and it largely keeps out of my way while offering the power of Ubuntu under the hood.</description></item><item><title>Apple: drink the cider</title><link>/posts/2018/apple-drink-the-cider/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2018/apple-drink-the-cider/</guid><description>Let me get this off my chest right now. I hate Apple. I hate iOS. I hate macOS. I hate the software, the hardware, and the ethos of Apple. To my mind, Apple represents the very worst of the technology industry: devices which are hard to use, easy to break, and difficult to fix. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;m never surprised when I see news stories like this one.
The long and short of this story is that Apple have implemented a new chip (the T2 chip) which can detect whether or not repairs to a broken machine have been carried out by a verified technician using a pre-configured pin code.</description></item><item><title>Personal matters</title><link>/posts/2018/personal-matters/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2018/personal-matters/</guid><description>This post is more of a rant than anything technical.
