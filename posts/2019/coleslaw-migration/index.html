Since I&rsquo;ve decided to try my hand at some common lisp I figured it would be a good time to start learning, and my goodness I wish I&rsquo;d started this sooner.</p><p>As part of this new experience I started looking into ways I could use Lisp in my everyday life. I quickly came across <a href=https://github.com/coleslaw-org/coleslaw>Coleslaw</a> as a recommended static site generator and decided to give it a go. There&rsquo;s a bit of a learning curve to it, and it doesn&rsquo;t really have the simplicity and wider appeal of alternatives such as Hugo and Pelican, but for the sort of thing I&rsquo;m doing it works wonderfully. The config is a joy to write (reminds me a lot of configuring my Guix system settings) and everything can be easily chopped and changed without too much worry. I can highly recommend it.</p><p>After years of Vim and VSCodium usage, I&rsquo;ve finally taken the plunge into Emacs and… I completely get it. This program is nothing short of magical. Again, lots of configuration and learning required (I have a 500 page manual sat on my desk for easy reference!) but once you&rsquo;ve got even the most basic commands down and some essential extensions installed you never want to leave it. It&rsquo;s just so damn fun to learn. I&rsquo;m going to see how it goes as my everyday IDE. It&rsquo;s already got me to uninstall Riot, Telegram, and Thunderbird from my machine…</p></article></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
