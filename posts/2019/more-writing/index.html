<a class=tag href=tags/website>website</a></aside></div><br><br><h2 id=and-now-for-something-completely-different>And now for something completely different</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been writing posts on this website for a little while now, mostly relating to my technological exploits and sysadmin misadventures. While this is a big part of my life at the moment, it&rsquo;s not the only thing I do. I&rsquo;m going to try and write a bit more about non-technology things just to try to encourage myself to focus on other things alongside computers.</p><h2 id=why>Why?</h2><p>Basically, computers have started to take over my life. I go to work every day and work with computers, writing more SQL than I am comfortable with. I administer my Funkwhale and Mastodon servers, which – while something I very much enjoy doing – takes up a lot of my time and money since I am still working it out and am paying for it off my back. I also tend to come home and hop straight on a computer to do… something. There&rsquo;s not always a goal. Sometimes I just kind of mess around on 4chan or Reddit for a few hours every night before going to bed, achieving absolutely nothing in the limited amount of time I have free after spending far too long at work.</p><p>I have other interests that I&rsquo;m keen to get back into. Chief among these is music, and I&rsquo;m looking to get back into recording and posting music up on <a href=https://tanukitunes.com/about>Tanuki Tunes</a> as a way of marrying up my passions. Another interest is writing. I&rsquo;ve started brainstorming ideas for a short story I&rsquo;d like to write, but I&rsquo;m a pretty piss-poor writer when it comes to sticking to an idea, so I won&rsquo;t hold my breath on that. The last – and easiest of these to achieve – is reading. As a child I was a voracious reader, but as time has gone on I have simply stopped reading. It&rsquo;s not that I no longer enjoy it, it&rsquo;s more that I find myself simply not bothering because it&rsquo;s much more quickly gratifying to waste time on the computer every day. This is something I guess I just need to balance better, as I don&rsquo;t want to lose interest in computers at all, but it can&rsquo;t be my only pastime.</p><p>I&rsquo;m probably going to post more ramblings here as it&rsquo;s an easy and safe way to rant about things in a more thought-out and constructive way than Mastodon. I used to very much enjoy having a blog. I should probably try to enjoy it again.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be making changes to this site over the next few days.</p></article></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
