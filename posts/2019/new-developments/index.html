To date I&rsquo;ve provided a couple of new (extremely simple) features and bugfixes, as well as leading a large project to restructure the documentation and provide a slew of new user guides. I&rsquo;ve also tried to get involved closely with the community and maintain an active role even when I can&rsquo;t necessarily contribute anything material to the project. Over the last week or so this has taken a back seat, however, due to…</p><h2 id=house-hunt>House hunt</h2><p>My partner and I are looking at buying our first place. Currently we are renting, but renting in Exeter is a painfully expensive and unrewarding experience. We&rsquo;ve found a flat in the centre of town that we both really like, and are now going through all the fun of trying to work out what a mortgage is and how we get one.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not fun.</p><p>We&rsquo;re uncertain at this point whether we&rsquo;ll actually be able to complete this move, but we&rsquo;re pretty hopeful that we can move swiftly enough to grab it while it&rsquo;s on the market. If we can, we&rsquo;ll be a lot closer to all of the things we&rsquo;re currently missing out on.</p><h2 id=work>Work</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been making leaps and bounds at work recently. A lot of the projects I&rsquo;ve been leading have been directly inspired by my work with Funkwhale, and I&rsquo;m happy to say that the projects to manage documentation in Markdown + Git as well as the process of managing mapping changes in Git have both been officially implemented and are being used across the board. It&rsquo;s been a bit of a fight, but it&rsquo;s been really good to see people get excited about the benefits a project is going to bring them.</p><p>That&rsquo;s really it for now. It&rsquo;s been a crazy busy month this month (not least with our insane political atmosphere at the moment), but hopefully something really good will come of it eventually.</p></article></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
