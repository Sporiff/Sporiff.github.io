After much head scratching, frustration, and eventually the building of an entirely new server, my Matrix server garappa.chat is up and running. This has been something I&rsquo;ve talked about doing for a while as I try to get away from all bigger services in favour of hosting my own. While Mastodon mand <a href=https://tanukitunes.com>Funkwhale</a> where considerably easier to set up, I have a feeling it will be worth it in the end.</p><h2 id=this-was-a-fight>This was a fight</h2><p>For as long as I&rsquo;ve used <a href=https://matrix.org>Matrix</a> I have used the flagship server due to how prohibitively difficult it seemed to be to set up a <a href=https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse.html>synapse server</a> Having tried setting the server up as both a Docker container and a native set of applications on the same server as the other two services, I eventually conceded that I was going to need a clean sheet for this one.</p><p>So to <a href=https://digitalocean.com>DO</a> we go to spin up a new VPS for my new whim. As I sat about getting the server itself ready for yet another Docker fight I decided to do some reading on other people&rsquo;s struggles with Synapse and what could be done about it. The results were pretty discouraging, with many people hitting quite significant dead-ends and being unable to fix the issue before their patience ran out. However, while looking into other server options I chanced upon a certain <a href=https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy>Ansible Playbook</a>…</p><p>Having never used Ansible before I started doing some poking around. In my first run I tried running it from the server as I was pretty much clueless when it came to what Ansible was or how it was supposed to work. After a while, though, I started to see some results. With each new parameter passed I was seeing features added. With one last push this morning I finally got S3 media uploads working, which should hopefully help some with storage costs. Now I want to use Ansible for everything. Whoops!</p><h2 id=less-exciting-news>Less exciting news</h2><p>With all that excitement here is a bit of less important but still fun news: this website will be written in <a href=http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>rST</a> instead of Markdown. The reason for this is trivial, but still important. rST is a proper standard and a really pleasing way to write documents. I can be confident that what I write in one place will render the same elsewhere in a way I can&rsquo;t always be with Markdown. MD is still one of my favourite tools and I use it extensively at work, but for now I&rsquo;m going to focus my efforts more on mastering reStructuredText for my work with <a href=https://funkwhale.audio>the Funkwhale project</a></p><h2 id=a-worthy-note>A worthy note</h2><p>As an aside, I have been having a fantastic time interacting with the FW community. A more supportive group of people I couldn&rsquo;t wish to know. The project keeps exceeding my expectations and the people involved show a real interest in improving the community and the level of interaction, which as a novice programmer is really encouraging to see.</p></article></section><footer>Copyright (c) 2022 Ciarán Ainsworth</footer></body></html>
