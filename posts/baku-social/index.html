<span class=reading-time>4-minute read</span></div></div><div class=alert><div id=indicator>!</div>Warning: This post is over 365 days old. The information may be out of date.</div><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a project recently to teach me some more about various technologies, specifically public cloud stuff like AWS and container tech like Docker. I have been looking to get into this stuff for a little while and even previously hosted on of my blogs on a container OS, but that was shortlived due to too many headaches with Wordpress containers. For the last few months I had also been looking for a way to replace Spotify – which I had left behind due to privacy concerns, costs, and library limitations (I listen to some… weird stuff). So when I heard about <a href=https://funkwhale.audio>Funkwhale</a> I decided this would be a good opportunity to give the whole Docker/Cloud thing a go.</p><h2 id=a-rocky-start>A rocky start</h2><p>Initially I opted to run the entire setup in AWS with an EC2 server and additional storage to host media files. This went well to begin with; setting up the server, DNS, and access to the service was very simple. I ran the site for a couple of days on this setup before realising that costs would quickly spiral out of hand. While AWS is fantastic for large-scale applications and deployments, it&rsquo;s not great for smaller projects with lower specs. The storage and network costs would quickly grow beyond what I was comfortable spending, and so I decided to call it a day with EC2 and fall back to my tried and true: Digital Ocean.</p><p>I opted originally to run a $40/month VPS with 8GB RAM, 4 cores, and 160GB SSD. This seemed logical seeing as I was going to be hosting media files on the server. At the time, I had placed my entire uncompressed library on the server, so it was taking up about 100GB of space just to host the files. This didn&rsquo;t bother me too much as the server spec included a lot of bandwidth as well, so I plowed ahead. I got nginx up-and-running, set Docker up successfully, and was easily able to listen to music out of the Funkwhale app. Very nice.</p><p>But this server is… expensive. And very powerful.</p><p>My biggest mistake in this move was picking a high-power VPS for its disk size rather than more sensibly choosing a less powerful machine and attaching an additional disk to it. As such I was now stuck with a whole lot of server hosting, well, my music library and nothing else. I didn&rsquo;t really have the room to add more music in future, and the server was too powerful to just have one Docker container running on it.</p><p>My solution? Find another project of course! I have been a longtime user of <a href=https://joinmastodon.org>Mastodon</a>, having moved away from sites like Twitter and Tumblr a while back due to toxicity and privacy concerns (again). While I was happy enough using <a href=https://fosstodon.org>Fosstodon</a> and <a href=https://mastodon.technology>Mastodon.technology</a> before, I was keen to start my own instance dedicated to Japanese mythology (my first true love). With the idea in mind, I looked up the guides and — after a few teething issues — had an instance running successfully.</p><p>Around this time I decided that I probably needed to downsize everything. The server was still too powerful and I had been stupid in my allocation of storage. So I decided to spin up a smaller VPS with half the power and a 100GB dedicated drive, compress all of my music, and migrate the whole thing over. After a brief conversation with the Funkwhale dev I was able to get the media root changed and have all music switched over to the external drive. Bonza.</p><h2 id=the-end-result>The end result</h2><p>The two federated instances are now successfully up-and-running. The Mastodon instance is <a href=https://bakusocial.com/about>Baku Social</a> and the Funkwhale is <a href=https://tanukitunes.com/about>Tanuki Tunes</a>. I&rsquo;m still monitoring the server, S3 storage, and general performance to see if the setup I&rsquo;ve chosen is right, but so far I&rsquo;m not seeing any particular issues coming up. All seems to be smooth sailing. I guess my big challenge will be managing upgrades and downtime, but I&rsquo;m yet to experience migrating to a new release.</p><p>These two projects are currently being managed, hosted, and paid for entirely by me. I don&rsquo;t mind this too much as I&rsquo;m currently the only one using the services so they&rsquo;re basically just my personal playing ground. However, I have also set up a <a href=https://patreon.com/CiaranAinsworth>Patreon</a> and a <a href=https://liberapay.com/CiaranAinsworth>Liberapay</a> to help cover costs should other people want to make use of the services.</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/blog/>blog</a></span>
