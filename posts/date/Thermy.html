<p>So I've been saying for a number of years that I'd really like to get into app development, 
but have never really had a project to work on. This is usually my struggle. I am the sort 
of person who learns by doing, but until I have a need to do something I can't bring myself 
to learn.</p>

<p>Following on from my <a href="https://rootkey.co.uk/posts/Elementary-Juno.html" >previous post</a> I have 
been using the latest release of elementaryOS for the last few days and having a poke around 
at their documentation. I've been really impressed by the relative simplicity of approach 
applications seem to have on the OS and the documentation. Having followed through a bit, it 
looks like the ideal platform for me to actually try and make my first app on.</p>

<p>The app will not be complicated (obviously). The idea is to combine two short programs I've written 
previously: a simple Vala/GTK app written along with an elementary guide and a C program I wrote a 
while back to translate temperatures between °C, °F, and K. Since I already have the basic calculations 
written out for this, I don't need to worry too much about the maths (which is my greatest foe).</p>

<p>Instead I want to focus on UX and UI, specifically with regards to how the app deals with input and 
output of text. I know exactly what the app to look like and how I want it to work, the trick is going 
to be tying together all the bits and pieces while also trying to teach myself enough Vala + GTK to 
make it look like it does in my head.</p>

<p>This is just a post jotting down thoughts and the like. Obviously, this is going to take me a while 
since I'm completely lacking in experience. Just thought I'd post something lest I forget to do the 
damn thing.</p>

<p>As a quick update, I've added thermy to my <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~sporiff/thermy" >Sourcehut</a> as (very much) 
a WIP. As the app is updated when I have time to spare I'll push it straight there. Wouldn't expect 
too much, though.</p>
