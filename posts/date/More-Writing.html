<h2>And Now For Something Completely Different</h2>

<p>I've been writing posts on this website for a little while
now, mostly relating to my technological exploits and sysadmin
misadventures. While this is a big part of my life at the
moment, it's not the only thing I do. I'm going to try and
write a bit more about non-technology things just to try to 
encourage myself to focus on other things alongside computers.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>Basically, computers have started to take over my life. I go 
to work every day and work with computers, writing more SQL
than I am comfortable with. I administer my Funkwhale and Mastodon
servers, which - while something I very much enjoy doing - takes
up a lot of my time and money since I am still working it out
and am paying for it off my back. I also tend to come home and
hop straight on a computer to do... something. There's not always
a goal. Sometimes I just kind of mess around on 4chan or Reddit for
a few hours every night before going to bed, achieving absolutely
nothing in the limited amount of time I have free after spending
far too long at work.</p>

<p>I have other interests that I'm keen to get back into. Chief among
these is music, and I'm looking to get back into recording and
posting music up on <a href="https://tanukitunes.com/about" >Tanuki Tunes</a>
as a way of marrying up my passions. Another interest is writing.
I've started brainstorming ideas for a short story I'd like to
write, but I'm a pretty piss-poor writer when it comes to sticking
to an idea, so I won't hold my breath on that. The last - and
easiest of these to achieve - is reading. As a child I was a voracious
reader, but as time has gone on I have simply stopped reading. It's
not that I no longer enjoy it, it's more that I find myself simply
not bothering because it's much more quickly gratifying to waste
time on the computer every day. This is something I guess I just
need to balance better, as I don't want to lose interest in
computers at all, but it can't be my only pastime.</p>

<p>I'm probably going to post more ramblings here as it's an easy
and safe way to rant about things in a more thought-out and
constructive way than <a href="https://bakusocial.com/about" >Mastodon</a>.
I used to very much enjoy having a blog. I should probably try to
enjoy it again.</p>

<p>I'll be making changes to this site over the next few days.</p>
