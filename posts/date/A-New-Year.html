<p>2019 was a bit of a rocky year, admittedly. With the country in
which I reside resigning itself utterly to lunacy, my relationship
ending, and a general descent in my mental health at several points
due to work and existing issues, it is not a year I will necessarily
look back on with much fondness. All is not, however, doom and gloom.</p>

<h2>Funky Friends</h2>

<p>Back in February of 2019 I started committing to <a href="https://funkwhale.audio" >Funkwhale</a>.
Initially I contributed only documentation, but as I spent more time
with the application I started to get more involved with the codebase.
I now regularly contribute small fixes and improvements, and I even
sit on the association's steering committee.</p>

<p>Participating in Funkwhale has been an incredibly rewarding experience
which I hope to keep going for as long as possible. In February, a whole year
on from the start of my engagement with the project, I will be travelling
to meet the collected association members in person!</p>

<h2>Hosting Hijinks</h2>

<p>Of course, 2019 was also the year that I got fully stuck into hosting my
own services. While <a href="https://tanukitunes.com" >Tanuki Tunes</a> and
<a href="https://bakusocial.com" >Baku Social</a> were technically spun up in December
2018, they didn't really start to see any traction until much later. I now
host 4 public services (Mastodon, Funkwhale, <a href="https://gitsune.site" >Gitea</a>,
and <a href="https://riot.garappa.chat" >Matrix</a>) and a private <a href="https://streamaservice.org" >Streama</a>
instance for me and my dad. I had always been interested in self hosting,
and I have to admit that I very much enjoy the challenge it presents.
Tanuki Tunes has been particularly popular, gaining over 200 users over the
course of the year ðŸŽ‰</p>

<h2>Hopes for the Future</h2>

<p>I was recently given a new job, which will mean that I will be transitioning
out of my current reactive support role and into a more constructive
technical account management role. While not the development role I was
hoping to get (in order to help me improve my coding knowledge), this
role should leave me with more time to work on projects, better pay, and
a chance to actually work a standard shift for once. No more tickets! No
more tickets!</p>

<p>That is, of course, if the UK doesn't decide to completely tear itself
apart over the next year...</p>
